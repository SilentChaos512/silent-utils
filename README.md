# Silent Utils

Just some helpful utility classes. Mostly intended for Minecraft modding, but could be used for anything.

To use, just add this to your build.gradle's dependencies:

```
dependencies {
    compile "net.silentchaos512:silent-utils:1.+"
}
```

Or replace "1.+" with a specific version if needed.
